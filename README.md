# Landing Page - Odin Project 2

## Introduction

After a thorough learning on the basics of HTML and CSS, I get to make a landing page especially using the concepts learned in CSS, most especially Flex Box. I will take one section at a time. I will write the HTML first then style the dofferent sections accordingly.

Learning the Box Model and FlexBox were probably the toughest things in Foundations of both HTML and CSS.

I have majorly used containers, i.e divs to style the content using FlexBox.
