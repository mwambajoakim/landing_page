# Landing Page - Odin Project 2

## Introduction

After a thorough learning on the basics of HTML and CSS, I get to make a landing page especially using the concepts learned in CSS, most especially Flex Box. I will take one section at a time. I will write the HTML first then style the dofferent sections accordingly.

Learning the Box Model and FlexBox were probably the toughest things in Foundations of both HTML and CSS.

I have majorly used containers, i.e divs to style the content using FlexBox.

## Head

On the header of my project I made containers for both the logo and links and also for the content tha goes down below those two.

This is a snippet of the HTML I used for the same.

```

 <div class="top-header">
                <h5 class="head">Header Logo</h5>
                <ul class="list">
                   <li class="li"><a href="#">header link one</a></li>
                   <li class="li"><a href="#">header link two</a></li>
                   <li class="li"><a href="#">header link three</a></li>
                 </ul>
            </div> 
```


A lot of it is just containers and on the styling sheet I used flexbox to move and center things around.
